I created this app in order to manage my todo list while learning new skills. it allows me to plan the tasks into todo list , the one that i am doing and the one that are already done.

I used the following technologies : 

React-redux-firebase: Redux bindings for Firebase. Includes React Hooks and Higher Order Components. https://github.com/prescottprue/react-redux-firebase
Reactstrap : https://reactstrap.github.io/
